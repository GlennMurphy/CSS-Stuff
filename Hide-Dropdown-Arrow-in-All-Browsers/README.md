##Hiding Select Dropdown Arrow in All Browsers.

I came across this while trying to find a cross browser solution to using a custom dropdown arrow for selets.
This solution seems to work well in Firefox, Chrome and IE 10, 11.

One of the most interesting things, I discovered while writing this is the `pointer-events:none` CSS rule.
